## Code of Conduct
We expect all contributors to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to ensure a welcoming environment for everyone.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- YOLOv3 or YOLOv4
- Pygame
- LabelIMG for image annotation

### Installation
1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your forked repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/traffic-flow-optimization.git
    ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd traffic-flow-optimization
    ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Project Setup
1. Set up YOLO for vehicle detection:
    - Download the pre-trained weights from the [YOLO website](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/).
    - Place the weights file in the `model/` directory.
    - Modify the configuration file (`yolov3.cfg` or `yolov4.cfg`) according to the classes and filters specified in the project.

2. Prepare the dataset:
    - Use LabelIMG to annotate images for training the custom YOLO model.
    - Place the annotated images in the `data/` directory.

3. Train the YOLO model:
    - Use the provided training script to train the model with the custom dataset.
